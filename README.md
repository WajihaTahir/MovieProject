In this project, I have created website using OMDB API to retrieve the information of any movie when a user searches for a particular movie or series. The technologies which I used in this project are HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, Javascript, Postman and Bootstrap. I also learnt about asynchronous JS and API calls. The project also offers the user to use filters through radio buttons so that they can retrieve the data based on 'search by movie' , 'search by series, 'show all'.In this project, I have created website using OMDB API to retrieve the information of any movie when a user searches for a particular movie or series.
